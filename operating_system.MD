# Operating system

## Why do we even need an Operating sytem

This can be different from different perspectives. An operating system at a basic level is a resource manager,
or can also be thought of as a platform

- For normal users, it's an interface for computing tasks
- For applications, OS provides a platform, various APIs to access computer resources. Declaring a variable is writing to the RAM, we can
open and listen on ports, write and read from the hard drive etc
- For developers, OS provides a platform for our programs to run

At a basic level, it is a resource manager. It manages the various resources such
as RAM, keyboard, monitor, CPU, LAN etc
