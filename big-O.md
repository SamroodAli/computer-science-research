# Big O

Big O helps us categorize algorithms so that we can compare them.
It categories algorithms on time and space based on the input.
It is not an exact measurement but more a way to help us developers.

## Some key facts about Big O
* It is based on the input. How does our algorithm's computation or memory grow as it's input grows
* We drop constants. As input grows, constants become less important
* We only care about the worst case.
